//Write comments for programs a & b.

/* For the program (a) we need to declare two variable
for the length and breadth then we need to print the statement
to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle.
By using the scanf command we need to store the values into the 
declared variable.

then we have to declare another to calculate the area
after calculating the area we have to print the calculated vaule 
we have to use format specifer to print the values


For the program (b) we need to declare a variable num and then using printf statement we have to 
print a statement to enter the number
then by using scanf statement we have to store the value using
correct format specifier.
Now we have to declare another variable to calculate the cube of the number
after that by using * sign we can calculate the cube by multipling the number three times
next we have to print the value using the printf statement and correct format specifier.*/
